\section{Introduction}
Due to the rapid progress in technology, there has been a staggering accumulation of data in all field of
studies. To decipher this vast data landscape, the necessity for analysis, along with the use of modern analytical
instruments and methodologies, has seen a significant surge. Analysts use these analytical tools to extract
unrecognized patterns from the past dataset.Similarly, sports data analysis is also growing fast. In the evergrowing arena of sports, the incorporation of analytics has turned out to be a pivotal point, by transforming theway teams plan their strategies, players training, and fans involvement with the game. In the realm of sports,
analytics hold a vital role in addressing challenges and competitions associated with every game.\\

These include,but are not limited to, the assessment and ranking of players based on their unique skills, the formation of teams
with a harmonious blend of these skills, and the ranking of these teams. They also aid in contract negotiations,
the appraisal of sports enterprises and their prospective revenue sources, and the orchestration of both physical
and mental training regimes.Moreover, they contribute to the formulation of strategies aimed at securing
victories in games and tournaments, the evaluation of the efficacy of coaches and referees, and the medical and
actuarial examination of sports injuries for health and insurance purposes.
